There are many places to get a barebones cloud server. I am going to use hostvds.com because of their very low price.There is a risk when we use a lower priced option that they may not be reliable. If this is important to you, try DigitalOcean or Linode. Current price for a standard 1 CPU 1 Gb of Ram is 0.79 euros per month on hostvds and $5 a month on Digital Ocean. Some providers  may even  give  trials on a basic server for  up to 12 months. Most services are similar. Create an account, enter basic details and link a payment.
