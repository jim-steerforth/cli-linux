SSH is a secure shell which allows you to connect to the command line of your remote server. It opens in a terminal window. The remote machine must be running OpenSSH and accepting connections.

There are different ways of running SSH depending  on your setup. SSH runs on any Linux distribution and can also be run from the Windows command prompt. SSH can also be run from an Android phone using Termux. It is best to have at least two ways of accessing your remote server with SSH.


### Termux

This is a Android terminal emulation with an extensive Linux package collection.  Useful for connecting to your cloud server anytime. Installation is covered here.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. In simpler language it alllows you to run Linux in a window under Windows 10. Installation is covered here.

### Linux Desktop

Linux runs a full desktop and is used by many as a replacement for Windows. It can be installed as  a dual boot  or a complete takeover of a computer operating system.

For dual boot,you first partition your disk in Windows so the partition is empty.  Linux is installed and takes over the disk. You can then start your machine in Windows or Linux. This has the potential to destroy your Windows installation if done carelessly.

If you have an old machine gathering dust, a full Linux install is easy. That can a useful development environment and test bed.

Suitable distributions are Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
