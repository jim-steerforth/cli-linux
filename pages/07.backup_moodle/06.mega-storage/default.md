 <p>   Dropbox wih 2 gB of storage not enough? Mega offers 50 gB, more obviously but may not be as reliable as Dropbox. Nothing to stop you from using both, that is your production server, and two copies each night on separate servers.</p>
<p>    Mega can sync to your home computer but this will mean downloads every night over your internet connection. Perhaps best to just use Megatools and send your updates straight from your productions server to the Mega account.</p>
<p>The latest version will be at https://megatools.megous.com/builds/experimental/<br>
You may have to adjust the version number.</p>
<code><pre>
cd ~/bin
wget    https://megatools.megous.com/builds/experimental/megatools-1.11.0-git-20200503-linux-i686.tar.gz
tar xvf megatools-1.11.0-git-20200503-linux-i686.tar.gz
</pre></code>

<p>This produces a directory structure with the tools in the megatools subdirectory.</p>

<p>megatools-1.11.0-git-20200503-linux-i686/<br>
megatools-1.11.0-git-20200503-linux-i686/megatools
</p>
<code>
cd megatools-1.11.0-git-20200503-linux-i686/megatools
