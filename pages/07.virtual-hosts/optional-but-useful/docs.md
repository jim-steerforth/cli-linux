With a virtual host setup, you can have several different domains running on the same server. For example I could have

*  host1.vdsbasic.xyz
*  host2.vdsbasic.xyz

Each has their own directory under /var/www/html and are running on our single server. Each request coming to the server is sent to one directory. Extra domains can also be purchasad and servicdecd by your server.

If you wish to run jost Moodle virtual hosts are not necessary.
